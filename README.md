## Description 
This is a command-line application that generates a team profile page based on user input. The user is prompted for information about the team manager and any number of team members, including engineers and interns. The application uses Jest to run tests and Inquirer to prompt the user for input. The final output is an HTML file that displays the team information.


## Installation 
```
git clone https://github.com/Khawk1017/Team-Profile-Generator-

cd Team-Profile-Generator-

npm install 

```

## Usage 
```
node app.js

```

## Test 
To run the tests, use the following command:
```
npm test

``` 
The tests are located in the __tests__ directory and use Jest for testing. There are tests for each of the classes used in the application: Employee, Manager, Engineer, and Intern.
